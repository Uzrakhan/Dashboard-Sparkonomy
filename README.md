üé® **Design & Layout**
This dashboard features a dynamic layout that intelligently adapts to different screen sizes.

* **Mobile View**: All components are stacked vertically in a single, clean column. The design prioritizes readability and easy navigation on smaller screens.

* **Laptop View**: The layout switches to a two-column grid. The "Create New Invoice" is grouped in the left column, while the financial metrics and the "Time Period" selectors are organized in the right column. This layout optimizes space and provides a high-level overview at a glance.
